MovieLens Project - Penalized Least Squares Approach.
This project has three files:
1) A script in R format that generates your predicted movie ratings and RMSE score
2) A report in R Markdown document. (Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents)
3) A report in pdf format which is generated from R Markdown document.

Note:
Few chunks of code in R script takes time to execute.  Before you open R markdown file and run the file, please ensure you have the latest version of 'xfun' and 'knitr' packages. If not, it may throw some error. You can download the packages from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xfun/index.html and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html. Download xfun version .19 in the windows binary "r-devel" area. Then install it in RStudio by selecting the package archive file option and then try tinytex::reinstall_tinytex(). You will able to knit the Rmd file into pdf document as described.
